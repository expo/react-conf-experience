# The React Conf Experience
The official mobile app for React Conf 2016.

## Project

Mockups from Thinkmill here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7spugbj4usjkmsy/AAC-iKIG2B0n8wGJSd57ngqUa?dl=0. There are quite a few complex features to implement so this is the Trello board that lists priorities and who's working on what: https://trello.com/b/1aQe7XX3/react-conf-experience.

Items noted as **Necessary** are needed for the conference app to be usable. Items under **Features** are nice to have. If you'd like to help and can commit to building a feature, add yourself as a member to its card and move the card under **In Progress** so we know who's working on what. When you're done with the feature, move the card to **Done**.

## How to run it (OS X)

1. Check out this repository somewhere on your computer.
2. Get set up with Exponent by downloading the Exponent app from the Play Store (Android 4.4+) or App Store (iOS 8+).
3. Then download XDE from here: https://github.com/exponentjs/xde/releases/latest
4. Launch XDE and click Open Project; select your copy of the repository you checked out. XDE will launch the packager.
5. Use XDE to send a development link to your phone that you can open with Exponent. You can also run the iOS simulator from XDE, install Exponent on it, and open the project in the simulator.
6. Make changes in your copy of the repository and refresh Exponent; on iOS, double-tap the Exponent button, and on Android, swipe from the top and tap the refresh button in the notification center.
